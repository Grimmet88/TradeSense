## How It Works

TradeSense uses a sophisticated multi-factor analysis approach:

### 1. Data Collection
- Fetches historical price data from Yahoo Finance
- Retrieves company fundamentals (P/E ratio, market cap, etc.)
- Collects recent news articles and headlines
- Gathers analyst recommendations
- Monitors major market indices

### 2. Analysis Components

**Technical Analysis (30% weight)**
- RSI (Relative Strength Index): Identifies overbought/oversold conditions
- Moving Averages: 50-day and 200-day trends
- Price Momentum: Recent price change analysis

**Fundamental Analysis (30% weight)**
- Valuation metrics (P/E, PEG ratios)
- Financial health (profit margins, revenue growth)
- Risk assessment (beta, volatility)

**Sentiment Analysis (20% weight)**
- Analyzes news headlines for positive/negative keywords
- Considers volume and recency of news

**Analyst Analysis (20% weight)**
- Aggregates professional analyst recommendations
- Considers consensus ratings and recent changes

### 3. Recommendation Generation
- Combines all signals with weighted scoring
- Generates BUY/SELL/HOLD recommendation
- Calculates confidence level (0-100%)
- Provides detailed breakdown of each factor
