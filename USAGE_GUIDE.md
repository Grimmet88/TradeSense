## Example Workflow

### Analyzing a Single Stock

1. **Run Analysis:**
   ```bash
   python tradesense.py AAPL
   ```

2. **Review Recommendation:**
   - Check the main recommendation (BUY/SELL/HOLD)
   - Note the confidence level

3. **Examine Each Component:**
   - Look for consensus across analysis types
   - Identify any conflicting signals
   - Check which factors are strongest

4. **Review Metrics:**
   - Compare current price to moving averages
   - Check valuation metrics (P/E, PEG)
   - Review recent news for context

5. **Consider Market Context:**
   - Check market indices performance
   - Note sector trends

### Comparing Multiple Stocks

Run TradeSense in interactive mode:

```bash
python tradesense.py
Enter stock symbol: AAPL
Enter stock symbol: GOOGL
Enter stock symbol: MSFT
Enter stock symbol: quit
```

Compare:
- Recommendations across stocks
- Confidence levels
- Key metrics (P/E, growth rates)
- Sector performance

## Tips for Best Results

### 1. Use Appropriate Time Periods

- **Short-term trading (days to weeks):** `1d`, `5d`, `1mo`
- **Medium-term trading (months):** `3mo`, `6mo`
- **Long-term investing (years):** `1y`, `2y`, `5y`

### 2. Look for Consensus

The strongest signals occur when multiple analysis types agree:
- All BUY signals = Strong buy opportunity
- Mixed signals = Exercise caution
- All SELL signals = Strong sell signal

### 3. Consider Context

- **Market conditions:** Bull vs bear market
- **Sector trends:** Is the sector performing well?
- **News events:** Recent earnings, product launches, etc.

### 4. Don't Rely Solely on One Tool

TradeSense provides valuable insights, but should be used alongside:
- Your own research
- Professional financial advice
- Diversification strategy
- Risk tolerance assessment

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Pre-Market Research
```bash
# Check your watchlist before market opens
python tradesense.py AAPL
python tradesense.py GOOGL
python tradesense.py MSFT
```

### 2. Portfolio Review
```bash
# Analyze your current holdings
python tradesense.py
# Enter each holding symbol
```

### 3. Finding Opportunities
```bash
# Compare similar stocks in a sector
python tradesense.py
# Enter: AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN
```

### 4. Trend Monitoring
```bash
# Check long-term trends
python tradesense.py AAPL 1y
python tradesense.py AAPL 2y
```

## Interpreting Results

### Strong Buy Signal Example
```
Recommendation: BUY
Confidence: 80%

‚úì Technical: BUY (RSI oversold, above MAs)
‚úì Fundamental: BUY (low P/E, strong growth)
‚úì Sentiment: BUY (positive news)
‚úì Analyst: BUY (consensus buy rating)
```
**Interpretation:** Multiple strong positive signals suggest good entry point.

### Mixed Signal Example
```
Recommendation: HOLD
Confidence: 45%

? Technical: BUY (strong momentum)
? Fundamental: SELL (high valuation)
? Sentiment: HOLD (neutral news)
? Analyst: BUY (analyst support)
```
**Interpretation:** Conflicting signals suggest waiting for clearer direction.

### Strong Sell Signal Example
```
Recommendation: SELL
Confidence: 75%

‚úó Technical: SELL (RSI overbought, below MAs)
‚úó Fundamental: SELL (high P/E, declining growth)
‚úó Sentiment: SELL (negative news)
‚úó Analyst: HOLD (mixed opinions)
```
**Interpretation:** Multiple negative signals suggest potential exit point.

## Troubleshooting

### No Data Available
- Check that the stock symbol is correct
- Ensure internet connection is working
- Try a different time period
- Some stocks may have limited data

### Conflicting Signals
- Review each analysis component individually
- Consider which factors are most important for your strategy
- Look at longer time periods for better context
- Wait for clearer signals before acting

### Low Confidence
- May indicate uncertain market conditions
- Consider analyzing over different time periods
- Look at similar stocks for comparison
- Wait for more data/clearer trends

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Analysis Weights

The default weights are:
- Technical: 30%
- Fundamental: 30%
- Sentiment: 20%
- Analyst: 20%

To customize (requires code modification):
```python
# In forecasting_engine.py
self.recommendation_weights = {
    'technical': 0.40,    # Increase technical weight
    'fundamental': 0.30,
    'sentiment': 0.15,
    'analyst': 0.15
}
```

### Batch Analysis

Create a script to analyze multiple stocks:
```python
from tradesense.forecasting_engine import ForecastingEngine

engine = ForecastingEngine()
symbols = ['AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'MSFT', 'AMZN']

for symbol in symbols:
    analysis = engine.analyze_stock(symbol)
    print(f"{symbol}: {analysis['recommendation']} ({analysis['confidence']:.1f}%)")
```
